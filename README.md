# laravel-hamapi

The Laravel HAM API package is used by the museums' public website, Exhibition Proposals and any other internal applications that benefit from a collections browse Service.

The package is available for use with Composer via Packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/harvardartmuseums/laravel-hamapi/.

The package needs to be refined and decoupled a bit more to be useful for general consumption.
